"""drto: dynamic real-time optimization for Pyomo models.

Receding-horizon NMPC and moving horizon estimation for ``pyomo.dae`` models.
The design is recorded in DESIGN.md and the feature specs under ``features/``;
the surface fills in feature by feature, starting with the registry
(``drto.info``).
