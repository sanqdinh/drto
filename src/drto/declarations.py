"""The dynamic optimization and simulation declarations (feature 002).

Each declaration function tags a Pyomo component, validates that it is of the
expected type and meets the declaration's convention, and records it in the
model's registry (``drto.info``, feature 001), where the transformations find
it. Declarations are the public surface: drto bolts onto an existing model
rather than replacing how the user builds one.

Every function serves two calling styles. Tagging: handed a component already
attached to the model, it registers immediately, so a finished model is
declared after the fact, interleaved or in one block. Wrapping: handed a
fresh (unconstructed) component, it returns it so it can sit in the
``m.x = ...`` assignment, and validation and registration fire when Pyomo
attaches it. The argument is always the component being declared, attached or
fresh: drto never constructs a component, so an index set where a component
belongs (``state(m.t)``) is a type error. The constraint-role declarations
additionally double as decorators, ``@drto.dynamics(m, m.t)`` taking the
model plus whatever ``@m.Constraint`` would take and building, attaching, and
declaring the constraint in one step. The styles mix freely per component;
the one rule, in every style, is that a declaration's prerequisites must be
declared by the time it registers, which writing the model top-down
satisfies.

Arity: the declarations that scale with the states and controls (``state``,
``control``, ``dynamics``, ``initial_condition``) take varargs when tagging
and accumulate across calls, rejecting duplicates; the wrapping form takes
exactly one component, since it is returned for a single assignment. The
one-of-each declarations (``horizon``, the stage and terminal costs, the
terminal constraint) take exactly one object and error on a second call with
a different one. ``steady_state`` and ``steady_state_control`` take one
(state or control, target Param) pair per call and accumulate.
