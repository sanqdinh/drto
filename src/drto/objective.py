"""Objective assembly: ``drto.build_objective`` (feature 003).

One routine owns objective installation for every mode. The default outcome
assembles the objective from the live registered cost groups, each with its
group's weights; the marked case, selected by the explicit ``zero`` option
that the simulation transforms pass, installs a constant-zero objective. The
function never infers a mode: callers request outcomes.

Liveness is component presence: a cost term is included when its backing
component is on the model and active at assembly time, so a mode drops a term
just by dropping or deactivating its constraint. Mode weighting travels as
group weights in the registry (a ``weight`` entry on the declaration record),
not as options here, and transforms may register additional ``cost_group``
records carrying their own per-point weights (the infinite-horizon tail,
feature 004).
