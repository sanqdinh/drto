[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `drto.build_objective` (feature 003): one routine owns objective
  installation. Default assembles the live registered cost groups by their
  weights (stage costs per active member, terminal cost, and generic
  registered `cost_group` records); `zero=True` is the marked simulation
  outcome. Also registered as `TransformationFactory('drto.build_objective')`.

- The declaration surface (feature 002): `declare_time`, `declare_state`,
  `declare_continuous_dynamics`, `declare_control` (profile via pyomo-cvp),
  `declare_tracking_stage_cost`, `declare_economic_stage_cost`,
  `declare_tracking_terminal_cost`, `declare_initial_condition`,
  `declare_terminal_constraint`, `declare_steady_state`, and
  `declare_steady_state_control`. Each validates its convention (either
  orientation of the equality), enforces the arity and re-declaration rules,
  and records in the registry.

- `drto.info` (feature 001): the per-model registry. Records declarations by
  kind and an ordered transformation log, backed by `Block.private_data` so it
  survives `clone()`/`create_using` with remapped component references, and
  renders a drto-aware view (console and notebook) with indexed constraints in
  compact symbolic form.

## [0.0.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- Repository scaffolding and the PyPI name reservation. Design phase: the
  declaration framework and the six modes are recorded in DESIGN.md and the
  README. No functionality yet.
