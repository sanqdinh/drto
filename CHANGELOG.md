All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on

[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `drto.parameterize` (feature 017): applies the declared control profiles
  by delegating to pyomo-cvp's declaration-mode transform, refreshes the
  registry to the replacement components, and records itself in the
  transformation log.

- `drto.infinite_horizon` (feature 004): the terminal segment of Dinh et al.
  (2025). Segment copies of the declared states and controls, dilated
  dynamics at interior Gauss-Legendre points, hard equilibrium endpoint, the
  tracking stage cost replicated as the tail integrand, and the tail cost as
  explicit Gauss-weighted terms, `(beta/dt)*phi_f`, registered as a cost
  group for `build_objective`. `beta` and `gamma` are mutable Params,
  symbolic in dynamics and weights; `gamma` defaults to the mesh rule.

### Changed

- `drto.infinite_horizon` replicates the stage cost as named Expressions
  rather than a cost Var with defining constraints: the tail adds no
  variables or constraints, and no bounded intermediates sit at their bound
  as the tail cost vanishes (192/154/66-iteration solves drop to 177/139/8
  on the Hicks study).

- `declare_time` captures the sample grid (the ContinuousSet's initialized
  points) and requires an undiscretized set with at least two points; the
  stage-cost sum in `build_objective` runs at the samples, keeping the finite
  horizon commensurate with the infinite-horizon tail.

- `drto.build_objective` (feature 003): one routine owns objective
  installation. Default assembles the live registered cost groups by their
  weights (stage costs per active member, terminal cost, and generic
  registered `cost_group` records); `zero=True` is the marked simulation
  outcome. Also registered as `TransformationFactory('drto.build_objective')`.

- The declaration surface (feature 002): `declare_time`, `declare_state`,
  `declare_continuous_dynamics`, `declare_control` (profile via pyomo-cvp),
  `declare_tracking_stage_cost`, `declare_economic_stage_cost`,
  `declare_tracking_terminal_cost`, `declare_initial_condition`,
  `declare_terminal_constraint`, `declare_steady_state`, and
  `declare_steady_state_control`. Each validates its convention (either
  orientation of the equality), enforces the arity and re-declaration rules,
  and records in the registry.

- `drto.info` (feature 001): the per-model registry. Records declarations by
  kind and an ordered transformation log, backed by `Block.private_data` so it
  survives `clone()`/`create_using` with remapped component references, and
  renders a drto-aware view (console and notebook) with indexed constraints in
  compact symbolic form.

## [0.0.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- Repository scaffolding and the PyPI name reservation. Design phase: the
  declaration framework and the six modes are recorded in DESIGN.md and the
  README. No functionality yet.
