"""drto-aware plotting for the example notebooks.

The functions read everything from the model's registry (``drto.info``): the
declared horizon and its sample grid, the declared states or controls, and
the paired steady-state targets for the dotted setpoint lines. If the model
carries an infinite-horizon terminal segment (``drto_infinite_horizon``), the
tail is found automatically, mapped back to real time through
``t = tN + atanh(tau)/gamma``, and drawn with open markers, squares marking
the segment's finite element boundaries (continuity extrapolations).

Each selected quantity gets its own fixed-size panel in a two-column grid.
Selection takes component names or components for time-only Vars, and member
strings like ``"x1[41,1]"`` for states carrying other index sets (a
multi-index Var must be selected by member: one panel per tray-by-component
combination is not a plot). With no selection, all time-only declared
components are drawn and multi-index ones must be named. Points only, finite
horizon filled, tail open, clipped to ``t_max``. The functions return the
list of panel axes for further tweaking.
