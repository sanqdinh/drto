# drto.dynamic_optimization

**Status:** ![ready](https://img.shields.io/badge/ready-blue)

## Description

As a user of DRTO, I want a transformation that assembles the dynamic
optimization problem from my declarations, so that I can solve for the optimal
control trajectory over the horizon without hand-wiring the objective and the
free and fixed variables.

## Benefit hypothesis

Assembling the horizon optimization from the same declarations that describe
the model keeps the problem model-consistent and frees the user from rebuilding
the objective and the decision-variable set by hand. This is the headline
dynamic-optimization mode (NMPC and D-RTO) that the closed-loop frameworks run.

## Acceptance criteria

- `TransformationFactory('drto.dynamic_optimization')` requires `declare_time`,
  `declare_state`, `declare_continuous_dynamics`, `declare_control`, and at
  least one of `declare_tracking_stage_cost` or `declare_economic_stage_cost`,
  and errors clearly if any is missing.
- It targets continuous dynamics. Discrete-time (difference-equation)
  optimization is a separate topic, out of scope for this transform.
- The declared controls are the free decision variables, parameterized over the
  time set by their declared profile (pyomo-cvp).
- The objective is assembled by `drto.build_objective` (feature 003) from the
  live cost terms over the horizon. When both a tracking and an economic stage
  cost are declared, both are summed into the objective, with a weight applied
  to the tracking stage cost. The transform accepts that weight as an argument,
  used only when both are present.
- `declare_tracking_terminal_cost`, `declare_terminal_constraint`, and the
  steady-state targets (`declare_steady_state`, `declare_steady_state_control`)
  are optional. The transform uses them if declared.
- Any estimation-category declarations on the model (measurements,
  disturbances, arrival cost, estimation stage and terminal costs, estimated
  parameters) are dropped.
- The transform keeps the time horizon and does not reduce the model to steady
  state.
- It works through both `apply_to` (in place) and `create_using` (a transformed
  clone).
