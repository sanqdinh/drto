# drto.build_objective

**Status:** ![ready](https://img.shields.io/badge/ready-blue)

## Description

As a user of DRTO, I want every mode to assemble my objective the same way from
the cost terms I declare, so that the objective is correct and identical across
modes and I never hand-write or maintain it.

## Benefit hypothesis

Owning objective assembly in one shared routine keeps the objective consistent
across every cost-bearing mode, the optimization transforms now and the
estimation transforms later, and removes drift-prone duplication. Each mode
decides which cost terms are live, and this routine sums them the same way every
time.

## Acceptance criteria

- `drto.build_objective(m)` assembles the objective from the live cost terms on
  the model (the cost declarations that are present and kept), installing
  exactly one minimize `Objective` summed from those terms. The mode transforms
  call it as their final step, so the assembly logic lives in one place.
- It is also registered as `TransformationFactory('drto.build_objective')` so a
  user can apply it on its own. The transform calls the same function, and both
  `apply_to` (in place) and `create_using` (a clone) work.
- The objective is the plain sum of each live stage cost's per-point cost var
  over its time index, excluding the last time point, plus each live
  terminal-cost var.
- For a time set over 0..N, the stage-cost sum runs over 0..N-1, and a live
  terminal cost applies at N.
- An existing active objective on the model is deactivated before the assembled
  objective is installed.
- If no cost term is live, it raises a clear error, since there is nothing to
  assemble.
