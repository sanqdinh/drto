# drto.dynamic_simulation

**Status:** ![ready](https://img.shields.io/badge/ready-blue)

## Description

As a user of DRTO, I want a transformation that fixes my controls and prepares
the dynamic model to be solved forward over the horizon, so that I can integrate
the model as declared without writing a separate simulation.

## Benefit hypothesis

Reusing the one declared model to simulate keeps simulation and optimization
consistent, and it is the building block the cold-start initializer and
validation runs rely on.

## Acceptance criteria

- `TransformationFactory('drto.dynamic_simulation')` requires `declare_time`,
  `declare_state`, `declare_continuous_dynamics`, and `declare_control`, and
  errors clearly if any is missing.
- The declared controls are fixed; the mode frees nothing and solves the model
  as declared over the horizon.
- The objective is just zero: the transform deactivates any existing objective
  and installs a constant-zero `Objective`, giving an NLP solver a well-posed
  square problem for the fixed-control model. It does not call
  `drto.build_objective`, since a simulation has no cost term to assemble.
- The transform keeps the time horizon.
- It works through both `apply_to` (in place) and `create_using` (a transformed
  clone).
